            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Much, and moſt deſervedly, Honoured,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW ſtale and ſuſpected ſoever the Pretence be, of extorting Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to inforce it, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of appearing in Print; yet no Man of Senſe, nay, Prejudice it ſelf, than which nothing is more ſenſeleſs, can judge me ſo far loſt, to all Sentiments of Truth, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, and common Prudence, as to appeal
<pb facs="tcp:53749:3"/>to ſuch unexceptionable Witneſſes in a Caſe that would not bear it.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, I was with ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy brought to let this Sermon ſee more Light, which unavoidable late going to Church, forc'd me to deliver in the Dark, that I rather need to beg Pardon for it.</p>
            <p>But when I had, almoſt to Rudeneſs, withſtood Requeſts, a Perſon of Quality tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned intreating into arguing, and inforc'd ſome Paſſages in the Sermon, with which he judged my Denials not well to conſiſt; then, as the Eagle, pierced with an Arrow feathered from its own Wing, my obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was vanquiſhed by my own Weapons; and with unwilling Willingneſs, I yielded to run the Risk of its loſing by the Eye, what it had beyond expectation gain'd by the Ear.</p>
            <p>I heartily bleſs God, that I have liv'd to ſee Judges in <hi>England,</hi> who cannot only bear, but approve ſuch honest plain preaching, and
<pb facs="tcp:53749:3"/>deſire it may be made publick, with hope that it will do ſome Service to the Nation.</p>
            <p>And if I may touch ſo ſmall a thing, (for I cannot own it needs Apology,) my citing ſo many Scriptures, I ſuſpect, will be ſtyled <hi>Nimiam Diligentiam,</hi> and but a ſolemn trifling: Be it ſo; yet I did not run into this right-hand Error blindfold. Had my buſineſs been only with Men's Ears and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I ſhould have uſed other Tools: But having to do with their Hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to cut down Sin, and build up Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I knew nothing ſo fit for my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which is quick and powerful, and the only Weapon fit to pull down the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan. God will be God, whether Sinners will or no; and his Word will retain an Awe upon Men's Minds, how unmodiſh ſoever it ſeem to urge ſo much of it; and will be a golden Sceptre to convince and rule, or elſe a Rod of Iron to condemn and to break in pieces.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53749:4"/>
            <p>And here I preſent it to your Honours, and the unprejudiced honeſt Readers, and if it may prove uſeful to the Publick, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Men of ſuch a Character, it ſhall ſuffice; (for a Plea for Righteouſneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be over-welcome to unrighteous Men till it convince them to forſake it;) and though it ſhould fall more ſhort of Acceptance from the Preſs, than it exceeded my Hopes from the Pulpit, I ſhall reſt ſatisfy'd in this Act of Obedience to my Betters, and Kindneſs to my Equals; and ſhall ſtudy to approve my ſelf more readily</p>

               <head>In the Text are evidently <hi>Three Parts.</hi>

               <item>I. A <hi>Subject;</hi> about which ſomewhat is affirmed: <hi>A Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Any People.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. Two very different <hi>Cauſes,</hi> affecting and influencing that Subject; <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sin.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. The <hi>Effects</hi> produced by theſe Cauſes; <hi>Exaltation, Repreach.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53749:5"/>
            <p>Which are as contrary to each other, as were the Cauſes from which they do proceed; ſo that there is an evident <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or Oppoſition between the two entire Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and every Word in either of them.</p>
            <p>And as Contraries <hi>ſet by</hi> one another, <hi>ſet off</hi> and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate one the other, the <hi>Text</hi> carries its own Commentary with it, and might help to explain it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But I will wave, and deny my ſelf that advantage; and to husband Time, confine my ſelf to the former Branch; <hi>Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation:</hi> Every Word of which, without Wreſting, or offering the leaſt Violence to them, may bear a Threefold Signification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Subject, Nation,</hi> may ſignifie, 1. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or Place inhabited: As, <hi>Take away our Place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> John 11.48.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>People</hi> inhabiting in ſuch a Place: <hi>O People, Nations, Languages,</hi> Dan. 3.4. Acts 2.5. But this is ſo common, it needs no Proof; and the very Text expounds it; making <hi>any People</hi> in the <hi>latter Branch,</hi> parallel to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Polity,</hi> by which ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are governed in ſuch a Country, defended from their Enemies, ſecur'd in their Rights, reſtrain'd from doing ill, encourag'd to do well, by Wiſe and Righteous Laws, and juſt Execution of them, by Rewards and Puniſhments: For, if <hi>Houſe</hi> may be put for the <hi>Maſter</hi> of it; as, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. <hi>This day is Salvation come to this Houſe, i, e.</hi> to <hi>Zacheus;</hi> as I find it expounded: And <hi>Church,</hi> for the ruling Part in the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell it to the Church.</hi> 'Tis not leſs proper to expound <hi>Nation,</hi> for the <hi>Government</hi> of a Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Cauſe, Righteouſneſs,</hi> with reſpect to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be conſidered as Threefold; (for <hi>Evangelical Righteouſneſs</hi> reſpects <hi>Perſons ſingly,</hi> not <hi>Nations complexly,</hi>) which we may call <hi>Religious, Civil, Moral Righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <hi>Religious Righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>Godlineſs</hi> or <hi>Piety;</hi> which gives to God the Worſhip and Service he expects; <hi>The Glory due unto his Name,</hi> Pſal. 29. Which is the Scope of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Civil, Legal, Political Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> conſiſting in due <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> by juſt diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments, according to the true Deſign and Intent of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Righteous Laws</hi> of every Nation and Society of Men, <hi>defending</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> thoſe who obſerve and keep them; and <hi>reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>puniſhing</hi> thoſe who tranſgreſs and break them; that the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> may be really the <hi>Terrer of evil doers, and to the Praiſe of them who do well,</hi> Rom. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moral Righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Probity,</hi> fair and upright dealing by <hi>private Perſons,</hi> betwixt Man and Man; the Source of which, is to <hi>love our Neighbour as our ſelves, Mat.</hi> 22.39. And that Golden Rule of our Saviour, to <hi>do to others, as we would they ſhould do to us,</hi> Luke 6.31. And the whole amounts to <hi>walking</hi> (in all capacities,) <hi>with all good Conſcience, void of offence towards God and Men,</hi> Acts 24.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The <hi>Effect, Exalteth:</hi> This alſo may imply Three Things; <hi>Honour, Safety, Plenty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>Exalt,</hi> ſignifies to ſet up on high in Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and Fame; <hi>To make thee high above all Nations which he hath made, in Praiſe, in Name, and Honour,</hi> Deut. 26.19. And the very Text intimates this, in oppoſing <hi>Reproach,</hi> to being <hi>exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Safety.</hi> To be ſet on high, oft ſignifies to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the reach of Danger To <hi>ſet him on high from him that puffeth at him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhall dwell on high, his place of Defence ſhall be the Munition of Rocks,</hi> Iſa. 33.16. <hi>He is my Shield, and my Salvation, my high Tower, and my Refuge, my Saviour, thou ſaveſt me from violence,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.3.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53749:6"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Plenty,</hi> and <hi>Proſperity;</hi> when it is with a Notion as <hi>David</hi> pray'd it might be with his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.13, 14, 15. <hi>That our Sons may be as Plants grown up in their youth, our Daughters as Corner-Stones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a Palace: That our Garners may be full, affording all manner of Store: That our Sheep may bring forth Thouſands, and ten Thouſands in our Streets: That our Oxen may be ſtrong to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: That there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our Streets: Happy is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is in ſuch a caſe.</hi> Happy, here, is conſignificant to being <hi>exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that enlarged Promiſe of exceeding Plenty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.11, 12. <hi>The Lord ſhall make thee plenteous in Goods, in the fruit of thy Body,—thy Cattel,—thy Ground.

            <p>Thus from this genuine Explication of the Words, you may pleaſe to take a comprehenſive view of this excellent Text, and graſp the Strength and Subſtance of it into one Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Religion and Piety, Juſtice and Equity, Probity and Honeſty, exalt into Honour and Renown, Safety and Peace, Plenty and Proſperity, a Nation,</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> in which they are found, the <hi>People</hi> by whom they are practiſed, the <hi>Government</hi> by which they are defended and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>In the handling which Propoſition, I ſhall ſet theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and bounds to my Diſcourſe, as the Method and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To confirm its Truth, that they do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the Seaſon and Circumſtances when they do it.</p>

            <p n="3">3. To demonſtrate the Reaſons why, or ſhew the Means by which they do it.</p>
            <p>All which I ſhall purſue as diſtinctly as I can.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Firſt, to confirm this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Piety, Juſtice, Honeſty,</hi> exalt <hi>Countries, People, Governments,</hi> in <hi>Honour, Safety, Plenty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There cannot be a more full and comprehenſive Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation given of any Truth, than what may be drawn to confirm this, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. in the 14 firſt Verſes, in all the Branches of it, which I muſt refer you to, being too long to tranſcribe and point at the Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When it goeth well with the Righteous, the City rejoiceth. By the Bleſſing of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright the City is exalted,</hi> Prov. 11.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Religion and Juſtice, are like the two Pillars <hi>Solomon</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before the Porch of the Temple, <hi>Jakin</hi> and <hi>Bouz,</hi> Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and Strength, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.21.</p>
            <p>Juſtice with Religion, as a Great Man hath obſerved, is the ſtrong Foundation, and the ſteddy Prop of States and Kingdoms: Therefore good Men are as <hi>Eliſha</hi> call'd <hi>Elijah, The Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof,</hi> 2 Kings 2.12.</p>
            <p>What a Bleſſing had ten righteous Men been to <hi>Sodom;</hi> for the ſake of ſo ſmall a number, God would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32.</p>
            <p>Peace is the Skin of a Nation; but <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are its Soul and Spirits: The rubbing off the Skin may make it ſore; but the loſs of Soul and Spirits bring Death without Remedy.</p>
            <p>Golden Chriſtians are truly the Brazen Walls and Iron-Gates which ſecure Cities.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom, that is Goodneſs or Piety, in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Stile, is better than Weapons of War, and ſtrengthneth more than Ten (a number of Perfection; that is, very many) migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men that are in the City, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.19.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall confirm the Truth of this Sentence, <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exalts a Nation,</hi> according to the more enlarged Senſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53749:7"/>of it, given in the Explication and Propoſition. By Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſervation and Experience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Aptitude and Tendency of ſuch Cauſes to produce ſuch Effects.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Firſt, God hath made good Promiſes that it ſhall be ſo. The Text is expreſs, and ſpeaks in the preſent Tenſe; for greater aſſurance, it exalteth to prove, it ſhall ſo do. I at preſent take the Promiſes for granted, and ſhall by and by produce them, and on that Suppoſition ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>
            <p>They being made, ſhall be made good; or elſe, either God cannot do it, or he will not do it.</p>
            <p>Not the firſt, for he is <hi>Almighty: He can do all things,</hi> Job. 42.2. Nothing is too hard for him. <hi>His Arm is not ſhortned, nor his Hand weakned,</hi> Jer. 32.27. <hi>With God nothing ſhall be impoſſible,</hi> Luke 1.37. He made Heaven and Earth with a Word, and nothing can withſtand, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Power; he doth whatever he pleaſes in the <hi>Armies of Heaven, and amongſt the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not the ſecond; for <hi>he is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10.23. They are the Promiſes of him that cannot lie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. not only <hi>will not,</hi> but <hi>cannot;</hi> and may as ſoon ceaſe to be God, as to be true. <hi>He is not a Man that he ſhould lie, or the Son of Man that he ſhould repent,</hi> Numb. 23.19. <hi>Hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it: Hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> See 1 Sam. 15.29.</p>
            <p>Now the Promiſes are ſo many of this kind, <hi>Inopem me copia fecit,</hi> the abundance of them diſtracts my Choice: And indeed it is the ſcope and drift of all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> both Perſonal and National; and of the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> to <hi>diſcourage</hi> and reſtrain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi> See at leiſure, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>But to touch a few: <hi>He withdraweth not his Eyes from the Righteous; yea he eſtabliſheth them for ever, and they are exalted,</hi> Job. 36.7.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53749:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhall judge the People with Righteouſneſs, and the Poor with Judgment; then, the Mountains ſhall bring Peace,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive word for all Proſperity, <hi>and the little Hills by Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 72.2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſs each other,</hi> as is ſaid of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> King of <hi>Salem;</hi> firſt <hi>King of Righteouſneſs,</hi> then <hi>King of Peace,</hi> Heb. 7.2. Righteous Kings ſhall inherit Peace to themſelves and People; <hi>for the Throne is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Righteouſneſs,</hi> Prov. 16.12. to them that ſit upon it, and over whom it is ſet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the Effect of Righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever. And my People ſhall dwell in peaceable Habitations, and in ſure Dwellings, and in quiet reſting Places,</hi> Iſa. 32.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, that deſpiſeth the Gain of Oppreſſion, and ſhaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, and ſtoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing of Evil; he ſhall dwell on high,</hi> Iſa. 33.15.</p>
            <p>See farther, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.3, 4: <hi>Execute Judgment and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:—For if you do this indeed; then ſhall there enter in by theſe Gates Kings ſitting upon the Throne of David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Experience confirms the ſame, the moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious juſt, and vertuous Nations, have, generally ſpeaking, been moſt flouriſhing; and the moſt righteous Governments the moſt renown'd and proſperous.</p>
            <p>'Tis a good Obſervation of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That God gave that proſperous Succeſs to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Dominion of ſo great a part of the then known World, for their Juſtice, Fidelity, Temperance, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and their Love and Practice of Moral Vertues, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Vice; in which they exceeded, and may juſtly riſe up in Judgment againſt moſt Chriſtian Nations; who, under ſo much clearer Light, and ſtricter Obligations, came ſo much ſhort of them, Time would fail me to inſtance in particular Perſons. How religiouſly tender
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53749:8"/>were they of the Publick Faith; when
<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Aul. Gal. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>o.</hi> 1. (Which Feſteem the moſt excellent Chapter in all his Book; containing a Vindication of the ſtrictneſs of the Roman Laws, and the impartial Execution of them, <hi>Noct. Art. Tu dictis</hi> Albane <hi>maneres.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> was rent in pieces, by four Chariots, for violating of it, when given to an Enemy.</p>
            <p>And be Men never ſo impatient to hear of it, 'twas thoſe that made the Reign of Q <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſo flouriſhing, and her Memory ſo dear to Engliſh-men.</p>
            <p>And the ſacred Story, from the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be a People, through all their Judges and Kings, till they ceas'd to be ſo; is a conſtant exemplification of this Truth, how Righteouſneſs ſet them up, and Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pull'd them down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shalt thou reign, becauſe thou incloſeſt thy ſelf in Cedar? Did not thy Father eat and drink, and do Judgment and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and then it was well with him. He judged the Cauſe of the Poor and Needy; then it was well with him. Was not this to know me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 22.15, 16.</p>
            <p>And 'tis a Method worthy of God, to proceed thus to make himſelf known; and to teach the ſtupid World this Leſſon, that the <hi>Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs;</hi> but them who do Iniquity, and love Violence, his Soul hateth.</p>
            <p>'Tis Righteouſneſs which keeps Deſtruction far off, or prevents it, when threatned and approaching. What ſav'd <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> from that mighty Hoſt, which came againſt them, but Faith, and Prayer, and Reformation? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>What delivered <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s Hoſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Hundreds of thouſands: but the Prayer of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King, the Miniſters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Juſtice; yea, routed his Army in a Night, by an <hi>Angel,</hi> ſlaying 185000, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>What ſav'd <hi>Nineveh</hi> from God's peremptory threatned Ruine within Forty days; <hi>but their crying mightily to God; turning every one from his Evil,</hi> and <hi>ceaſing from the Violence that was in their Hands, Jonah</hi> 3.4. where we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53749:9"/>may eaſily take notice of all the Three Branches of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> in our <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They <hi>cried mightily to God;</hi> there's <hi>Piety:</hi> They <hi>ceaſed from the Violence of their Hands;</hi> there's <hi>Juſtice:</hi> They <hi>turned every one from the Evil of their Ways,</hi> there's <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honeſty,</hi> or <hi>Probity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This Truth may be confirm'd, from the relation there is between Cauſes, and their Effects. We eaſily believe the production of Effects, when we ſee Cauſes prepared, apt and fit to bring them forth; as, That things ſhall be burnt, when we ſee them caſt into the Fire; that Men's Hunger and Thirſt ſhall be ſatisfied and ſlaked, when we ſee them eat and drink what's wholeſome in both kinds.</p>
            <p>Now Piety, Equity, Honeſty, are Cauſes, as fit to bring forth Honour, Safety, and Proſperity, as any Cauſes can be to produce their proper Effects: And that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> With reſpect to God, the <hi>Righteous Judge of all the Earth;</hi> who will as certainly encourage and reward them, as puniſh the Contraries. Mark <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Plea for <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 18.25. <hi>To ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked, and that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked, that be far from thee; ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Abimelech</hi> pleaded his Innocency for his Safety, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Wilt thou ſlay alſo a righteous Nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs;</hi> and he will act ſo, that a <hi>man,</hi> any man that takes notice of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, <hi>ſhall ſay, doubtleſs there is a reward for the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; doubtleſs there is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 58.11. <hi>Every man may ſee it, man may behold it afar off,</hi> Job 36.25. He that runs may read it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, as to particular Perſons, God's Proceedings with them, are not always ſo obvious; becauſe he hath another Place and Time to reckon with them, and reward them, and on purpoſe forbears preſent Payment; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to prove there is a future Judgment. But for Nations, as Nations, this is the proper Seaſon for Rewards, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53749:9"/>Puniſhments, the Nations of the World ceaſing to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when the World ſhall ceaſe to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> With reſpect to the Things themſelves; they have an apt Tendency to produce ſuch Effects; they are as Seed which brings forth Fruit of its own kind: As Wheat bears Wheat; ſo Righteouſneſs bears Honour and Safety. As Grace is the Seed of Glory future to Perſons; ſo theſe Vertues are the Seed of Glory preſent to a Nation. <hi>His Salvation is nigh to them that fear him, that Glory may dwell in our Land,</hi> Pſal. 85.9. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and Gladneſs for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. Theſe <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Gladneſs</hi> are comprehenſive Words, including all we ſpeak of to make a People happy; and as they are ſown for the Righteous; ſo Righteouſneſs is the Seed ſown, from whence they ſpring; <hi>Glory to the Righteous,</hi> was the Prophet's Song, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.16.</p>
            <p>We oft meet this Expreſſion, <hi>tendeth</hi> to—<hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tendeth to Life,</hi> Prov. 10.16.—11.19. Religion and Juſtice, they have a propenſe Tendency to the production of theſe things; and we may thence conclude, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly produce them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe Waters of the Sanctuary, which <hi>heal all to which they flow, and give Life to every thing whither the River cometh,</hi> Ezek. 47.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When do they do it? In what Seaſon and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer; When Religion and Juſtice become National Vertues, are in Eſteem and Reputation, and 'tis Men's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to own and practiſe them.</p>
            <p>As there is no Temptation greater, than for men to find, or think it their Intereſt to be wicked; for few eſcape that Snare: So no Conjuncture is happier, than when 'tis men's Intereſt to be good and vertuous; for that encourages many to be truly ſo, and invites more to appear ſuch; when a Nation exalts theſe, they will exalt that Nation. <hi>Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee; ſhe ſhall bring thee to Honour,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53749:10"/>when thou doſt embrace her; ſhe ſhall give to thine Head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee,</hi> Prov. 4.8, 9.</p>
            <p>But ſome may farther ask, When may <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> be eſteemed National, that we may expect and hope for theſe Effects from it?</p>
            <p>To which, let me firſt ſay without offence, I heartily wiſh that we knew this ſo well by a guſty reliſhing, and ſweet experience; that it were needleſs to be taught it by dry, and more inſipid ſpeculations; and that we had not known it by its Contraries, more feelingly, than by it ſelf, and by the <hi>Vexations wherewith God did vex us with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> for our unrighteouſneſs; as <hi>Azariah</hi> ſpake to <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.6.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, I'll tell you in a Word, when it will not do it; When it is diſcountenanced, look'd upon askew, with a ſuſpicious and a jealous Eye, reproach'd, ridicul'd, ſcorn'd, hated, perſecuted, that Men are made aſhamed and affraid to own it.</p>
            <p>The Righteous God will not exalt that Nation which thus treats <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> unleſs for ſome little Time, <hi>ut graviori lapſu ruant;</hi> that the higher they are lift up, their Fall may be more conſpicuous to others, and more painful to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> then become, and are to be eſteemed National;</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they are practiſed and encouraged by the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; whoſe ſpecial Province, and peculiar Duty it is to do it. Great is the influence of Example; but the Example of Great Men it of greateſt influence. The Court ſets the Faſhion, and is the Standard to City and Country, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Garbs, but Manners? For, as when a <hi>Ruler hearkens to Lies, all his Servants are wicked,</hi> Prov. 29.12. So a <hi>wiſe King, which ſits on the Throne of Judgment,</hi> whoſe Throne is a Throne of Righteous Judgment, <hi>ſcattereth all Evil with his Eyes, and bringeth the Wheel over the Wicked, Prov.</hi> 20.8, 26.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53749:10"/>
            <p>If a Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhine in that Orb, (give me leave to uſe that Phraſe in an inferiour, ſecondary Senſe,) he heals the Nations of their Impiety and Oppreſſion: But if it be eclipſed, or turned into Bloud, thick Darkneſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all the Nation.</p>
            <p>There ſhines the Moon, which governs the Tides of Vertue and Vice; and they riſe and fall, ebb and flow, as influenced thence.</p>
            <p>'Tis almoſt conſtant in the Sacred Hiſtories, to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, as to Religion or Wickedneſs, according to the Diſpoſition of their Great Men. When the Great Men were <hi>Rulers</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the Inferiours are <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> Iſa. 1.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Piety and Honeſty, and Fidelity and Ability, are eſteemed the beſt Qualifications for publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the next Steps to Preferment, and no dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Terms, are not a Bar, or Stainant Colours in a Man's Coat-Armour. Unrighteous Governments muſt have Tools ſuitable to their Deſigns and Work, and Honeſt Men will not do diſhoneſt Things; and therefore are not for their Turn, and 'tis well if they can ſcape with only being neglected. <hi>Bonus Vir</hi> Cajus Seius, <hi>ſed Chriſtianus:</hi> So ſuch and ſuch are Able Men, Honeſt Men; but they are too Preciſe, too Zealous, and Strait-lac'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Ruine of Nations, when Ambitious Men court high Places, and are admitted to them for Favour, or for Money; for they that buy, muſt ſell; Firſt, Themſelves, to do wickedly: Next, The Righteous, and their Cauſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſcorn to purchaſe what the Laws of God and Men had given them ſo juſt a Claim and Title to.</p>
            <p>But happy the Land where <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Counſel is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; to <hi>place able Men, fearing God, Men of Truth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Covetouſneſs, over the People,</hi> Exod. 18.21. <hi>When the Righteous are in Authority, the People rejoyce,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 29.2. And Reaſon good they ſhould; for then <hi>Piety, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Probity</hi> are like to be promoted.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53749:11"/>
            <p n="3">3. When 'tis approved by moſt, and practiſed by many; good <hi>Looks</hi> and good <hi>Company,</hi> are two great advantages to make Piety and Honeſty thrive and ſpread: Theſe are like the <hi>Solum</hi> and <hi>Caelum</hi> to a Plant; good Soil, and good Sun and Rain, fertile Earth, and kind Heaven; when 'tis not daſh'd out of Countenance, with a wrinkled ſcowling Brow; nor forc'd into the Stable, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the Bleſſed Virgin, when there was no room for them in the Inn, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. Or, like a ſpeckled Bird, muſt fly into the Wilderneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Birds of the Foreſt are all againſt it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.9. and conſtrain'd to ſigh out <hi>David</hi>'s Option, <hi>O that I had the Wings of a Dove, to fly away to be at reſt,</hi> Pſal. 55.6. Or to ſit as a Sparrow alone upon the Houſe-top; becauſe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Gates, and Concourſe of the People, none will regard her.</p>
            <p>How can Righteouſneſs be counted National; when a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abhors it; and its own Mother's Children account it a Stranger and an Alien?</p>
            <p>But when they, who <hi>ask the way to Zion, with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thitherward,</hi> Jer. 50.5. go, as the Tribes went to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> in Troops, and with Muſick; then weak Hands and feeble Knees, weary Legs and fainting Hearts, renew their Strength, and mount up as Eagles; and Religion ſpreads amain, like the Vine which God brought out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which when his Hand planted, fill'd the Land, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When 'tis ſcorn'd by few, perſecuted and ſuppreſs'd by none; then as the Goſpel, when it hath a free Courſe, runs, and is glorified, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. when the Stream of Righteouſneſs hath no Dams in its Chanel, to obſtruct its flowing, it will, like <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the time of Harveſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow its Banks, and water the Land, as <hi>Nilus</hi> doth <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to make it fertile: When neither the Sword of the Mouth, nor the Mouth of the Sword are whet againſt it: When no Arrows of invenom'd bitter Words, dipp'd in the Poiſon of Aſps, are ſhot againſt it: 'Tis not ſtigmatized, or branded with opprobious Names, which blaſt it as the burning Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53749:11"/>nips the tender Buds; and when the Foot of Violence cannot approach to hurt it; but thoſe Dogs, who delight to worry, and to ſuck the Blood of the Lambs of Chriſt, are ſo muzzled or chain'd up; that, though they may grin and ſhow their Teeth, they cannot tear and rend them. But Men may be as good as they will, and the Grace of God excites and enables them to be; and the Voice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſay to them, even in this Life preſent, what Chriſt ſpoke, with relation to the Life to come: <hi>Fear not little Flock,</hi> Luke 12.32. And what our Lord ſpeak in a Viſion to <hi>Paul: Be not affraid; but ſpeak, and hold not thy Peace; for I am with thee, and none ſhall ſet upon thee to hurt thee,</hi> Acts 18.9.10. And Righteouſneſs obtains that Privilege, with which St. <hi>Luke</hi> concludes the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> in relation to St. <hi>Paul. He received all that came into him, preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all Confidence, no Man forbidding him.</hi> When the Children of God are not at the proud, and cruel Mercy of the Slaves of Satan; nor at the Will of them who hate them for their Father's ſake. When a Nation is an holy, ſafe, and quiet Habitation to righteous Men. When under <hi>Kings, and thoſe in. Authority, we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honesty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2. as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs us to pray; and as our own Liturgy excellently teacheth us, with Fervency, to beg for our King and Queen; That in all their Thoughts, Words, and Actions, they may ever ſeek God's Honour and Glory, and ſtudy to preſerve the People committed to their Charge, in Wealth, Peace, and Godlineſs. In ſuch a Seaſon, <hi>Piety, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> are in a hopeful way to be exalted in a Nation; and then they will exalt that Country, People, Government, in Honour, Safety, Plenty; which was the ſecond Head of Diſcourſe, to ſhew when, or in what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Time it doth it.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53749:12"/>
            <p>I proceed to the third Head to be diſcourſed on, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To demonſtrate the Reaſons why, and ſhew the means by which, Piety, Equity, Probity, thus exalt a Nation. And though they are many, Time will allow me to inſiſt upon but few of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt and principal is; becauſe they engage God to be God of ſuch a Nation, and to own them, and bleſs them as his People: To demonſtrate this, might ſuperſede the reſt as needleſs; or leave them but as Grains to be caſt into the Balance, which add but little to the main weight.</p>
            <p>I may ſay of this, as the great Stateſman; who, being ask'd what was the wiſeſt, and ſafeſt way to govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wrote in the top, the middle, and foot of the Page, <hi>Moderation, Moderation, Moderation:</hi> Or, as the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; who was ask'd what was the chief Excellency of an Orator, reply'd, <hi>Pronunciation, Pronunciation, Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So may we truly anſwer him, who asks what exalts a Nation, with redoubled Repetition, <hi>God's Preſence with them:</hi> This is the Firſt, the Second, and the Third; this is truly all in all.</p>
            <p>'Twas a bold Motto that King us'd, <hi>Cui adhaereo praeeſt,</hi> He prevails whoſe part I take.</p>
            <p>But it is certainly ſo with thoſe, on whoſe ſide God vouchſafes to be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee,</hi> is full Security.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us,</hi> Rom. 8.31. Let who will; let who dare <hi>kick againſt the Pricks,</hi> they are like to have a hard Task, and they are ſure to be over-match'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what Man can do unto me,</hi> Pſal. 118.6. 124.1, 2. When <hi>David</hi> ſpent many Verſes, in recounting what makes Nations flouriſh in Men's Eſteem; and concluded, <hi>Happy is the People which are in ſuch a Caſe;</hi> he corrects himſelf in the laſt Words, yea, <hi>Happy is that People whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144. ult.

            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53749:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>In his Hand is Power and Might, ſo that none is able to withſtand him,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.6. as <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> ſtrengthned his own Faith, and the Faith of his People.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> as fully, as excellently: <hi>Thine O Lord is the Greatneſs, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majeſty; for all that is in Heaven, and in Earth is thine. Thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as Head above all. Both Riches and Honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all; and in thine Hand is Power and Might; and in thine Hand it is to make great, and to give Strength unto all,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Safety is of the Lord, as the holy Father <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 3.8. and the wiſe <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 21.31. both aſſure us.</p>
            <p>Yea, how oft and fully doth <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, acknowledge God's abſolute Dominion, as <hi>God of Gods, and Lord of Kings,</hi> Dan. 2.47.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Dominion is an Everlaſting Dominion, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Generation to Generation. All the Inhabitants of the Earth are as nothing: He doth according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; None can ſtay his Hand, or ſay, What doeſt thou,</hi> Dan. 4.34, 35.</p>
            <p>How oft doth <hi>David</hi> call him his Strength? And when 'tis ſaid of <hi>Sampſon, his Strength departed from him;</hi> the next Verſe explains it, telling us, <hi>God was departed from him, Judg.</hi> 16.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Excuſe my overdoing in ſo plain a Caſe; I muſt ſuppoſe they have no Bibles, or uſe them not, or believe them not to be God's Word, that need more.</p>
            <p>Now to have this <hi>All-ſufficient God</hi> to be with us, and to be <hi>our Sun and Shield, we muſt walk before him, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> which I look upon, not as ſpoken to Perſons only, but to <hi>Nations,</hi> becauſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom God ſaid upon the changing of his Name, and the reaſon of his doing it, <hi>A Father of many Nations have I made thee, and I will make thee exceeding fruitful; and I will make Nations of thee,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53749:13"/>and Kings ſhall come out of thee,</hi> Gen. 17.5, 6. He was to be the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> and <hi>all Nations</hi> were to be <hi>bleſſed in him:</hi> 'Tis ſpoke to the Nations then in his Loins. The Lord will be with them that are with him. Hear what <hi>Azariah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aſa,</hi> when <hi>the Spirit was upon him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you while you are with him. If you ſeek him, he will be found of you; if you forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> Yea, what God himſelf ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Him that honoureth me, will I honour; but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> The Lord will <hi>do good to them that are good, and upright in their hearts.</hi> He will be with the good Magiſtrate, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> told his Judges, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.11. and with a good People, as all his Words aſſure them.</p>
            <p>I will urge one Scripture more; 'tis <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it, if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the Good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi> Let us pauſe here. I confeſs my Infirmity; this Scripture ſtrikes me with horror and amazement.</p>
            <p>Never did the Voice of Providence ſpeak more audibly, more diſtinctly, more intelligibly, and more encouraging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning a <hi>Nation, to build, and to plant it,</hi> than in the late Revolution; and Opportunity not only afford it ſelf, but even preſs'd upon us, to make us <hi>a righteous Nation,</hi> and an happy People; and it may be, never was a Work, in it ſelf ſo hard, rendered ſo eaſie to have been accompliſh'd, had it not been our own fault; and whether it be recovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not paſt remedy, God only knows; and the things of our Peace hidden from us, becauſe we would not know them in the day of our Viſitation.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53749:13"/>
            <p>There are many Texts of Scripture have a Black, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, <hi>Saturnine</hi> Aſpect upon our Circumſtances; a few of which I'll point to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>In thy filthineſs is Lewdneſs; becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from thy Filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to rest upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God's Call is entertained with a deaf ear, and his manifeſted expectation fruſtrated and diſappointed; which is our Caſe, if ever it were the Caſe of any Nation under Heaven; then ſurely <hi>this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till you die, ſaith the Lord God of Hosts,</hi> Iſa. 22.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4.17.—7.8. <hi>Ephraim is a Cake not turned. England</hi> is joyned to Profaneneſs and Formality, Dough-bak'd, Cruſted on the outſide with the Form of Godlineſs; but raw within, and cold at heart, as to the Life and Power of it. <hi>O Jeruſalem, wilt thou not be made clean; when ſhall it once be?</hi> Jer. 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Such a State of a Nation God puts himſelf to a loſs what to do, to them, or with them. <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee?

            <p>The good Lord avert the bad <hi>Omen,</hi> given by our obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Unrighteouſneſs, (the grey hairs of which are already upon us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. though moſt are ſo blind, they know it not; and none ſo blind as thoſe who will not ſee;) that it be not to us, according to the Folly of our Provocations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Righteouſneſs makes Nations flouriſh, <hi>Removendo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibens;</hi> by putting a ſtop to, and rooting out thoſe Vices which blaſt, and make them wither?

            </p>
            <p>That thoſe, whom the Love of God, Themſelves, and Country, will not conſtrain to be good, the Fear of the Sword of Juſtice may reſtrain, from being, at leaſt openly, ſo bad, as their unbridled Luſts would hurry them to be, were that coercive Curb removed.</p>
            <p>Such Sins, to inſtance in a few, which deſtroy Kingdoms, are,</p>

And the chief which brought Hell out of Heaven upon <hi>Sodom, Jude</hi> 7. the two ſtanding Inſtances of Divine Indignation, ſet up to terrifie all ſucceeding Ages from the like.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Riot,</hi> which drown Men in Sottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bereave them of the Force, both of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> their <hi>Reaſon</hi> and their <hi>Hands</hi> to preſerve themſelves, and make them <hi>forget the Law, and pervert the Judgment of the afflicted,</hi> Prov. 31.5.

            <p>
               <hi>Pride,</hi> and all its Retinue, the Rabble of Vices which are preſs'd to ſerve it; which are not eaſily reckon'd up.

            <p n="3">3. It doth it <hi>promovendo adjuvans,</hi> by promoting what greatly contributes to it. All that beautiful Train of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are the Ornament, and Eſtabliſhment of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> and the <hi>Offspring</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> brought forth, or brought up by it.

            <p>
               <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> which make Families and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms rich. But who will be diligent, when the more he acquires, the fairer Mark and Prey he is to oppreſſive Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; from which there is no Juſtice to ſecure and defend him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> the great Allurement to Trade and Commerce: For who will deal with Treachery, and Falſhood, where nothing is to be expected but Cozenage, and Fraud?</p>
            <p>So <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> which nothing raiſes like a good Conſcience, which is <hi>Murus aheneus,</hi> or guards ſo well as <hi>the whole Armour of God;</hi> a chief Piece of which is a <hi>Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Eph. 6. <hi>The Righteous are bold as a Lion; but the Wicked fly when none purſue them,</hi> Prov. 28.1. And at beſt, can be but Fool-hardy, for not conſidering their Danger.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53749:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Conſideration;</hi> which are drowned in Exceſs and Riot. Vice inſatuates Men, and befools them. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Wine take away the Heart,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. and make Sots.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publick Spiritedneſs,</hi> and a natural Kindneſs to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Land. The Motto of which, is, <hi>Suſtine, Abſtine;</hi> Bear, and forbear. What is ſaid of Charity, <hi>It beareth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. is true of a generous Love of our Country: It will make us bear the Burthens neceſſary for its Preſervation, without murmuring and repining, and will forbear ſelfiſh Satisfactions, which are not conſiſtent with the Publick Good; as particular Nature yields, and gives place to univerſal Nature, for its preſervation.</p>
            <p>So <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Concord.</hi> Piety and Probity are the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and Bands which faſten Men together. <hi>See how they love one another,</hi> uſed the very Heathens to ſay of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians. There may be Conſpiracy amongſt Thieves and Traytors; but true Concord only amongſt Righteous Men. The Philoſopher obſerved long ſince, That <hi>Friendſhip is only amongſt good Men.</hi> 'Tis a Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace, by which is conveyed all that makes us good; That <hi>God will give them one Heart, and one Way; Jer.</hi> 32 39, 41. And then it is added, <hi>I will eſtabliſh them aſſuredly; with my whole Heart, and my whole Soul.</hi> A Kingdom divided cannot ſtand; the Emblem of the Sheaf of Arrows is lively; every ſingle one a Child may ſnap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; but bound up together, the ſtrongeſt Arms cannot break them. Religion hath its Name <hi>à Religando,</hi> from binding us to God, and one another: Where the Soul and Subſtance of Righteouſneſs is duly minded, Men have no leiſure to quarrel about its Shadow, and Trimming.</p>
            <p>The Time would fail me to enumerate half the Vertues which ſecure, and beautifie; or Vices, which deſtroy, and blot a Nation with Reproach. I muſt leave them both to be ſuggeſted by your own Thoughts; all which, prevailing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53749:15"/>Piety and Probity, plant, or root out; lift up the Face of one, and make the others hide their Heads.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> exalts a Nation, by furniſhing it with able Men, fit for the Truſts and Employments in which they are engaged; than which, nothing can be deſired, or conceived more conducive to ſo Noble an End. How can that Ship eſcape a Wreck, at the Helm of which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful, or unfaithful Hand, eſpecially, in ſtormy Weather, or amongſt the Rocks?</p>
            <p>Religion extends to all Relations, and will make Men conſcientious in diſcharge of their relative Duties, with the utmoſt Care. They will not dare to undertake them, without, at leaſt, competent Abilities; nor continue in them, without faithful improving thoſe Abilities: Yea, when <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is the Air, and prevailing Element of a Nation, the Youth will ſuck it in, in the Nurſeries of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which furniſheth it with Worthy Men in Church and State; which proves an ineſtimable Bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By rendring the Subjects quiet, and obedient, and ready to ſupport the Government for Conſcience ſake to God, and Gratitude to Men, and from a Senſe of their own Happineſs, they enjoy under it, and an awful Veneration with which that Government affects them, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with Piety and Equity.</p>
            <p>For as an harſh and tyrannous Rigour renders it hateful, and an over remiſs Facility renders it deſpicable, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of Wickedneſs, and Vice, renders it abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and to the Conſciences of all Men;</p>
            <p>So countenancing Religion, and diſtributing Juſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and yet with Moderation, fills a Nation with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Veneration, Love, and Good-Will; which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, is the beſt Security of Thrones, and thoſe which ſit upon them; and therefore <hi>Machiavel</hi> would have Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to be righteous, or at leaſt to ſeem ſo, to charm the People to that Eſteem of them, which is neceſſary for the Safety of themſelves, and Countries.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53749:16"/>
            <p n="6">6. As Righteouſneſs renders the Government eaſie and belov'd at home, ſo ſecure from abroad; which two fill both the Pages of a People's Wiſhes.</p>
            <p>Now it ſecures a Nation, by preventing unjuſt Quarrels, and provoking needleſs Troubles from Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thoſe Governments which have extinguiſhed all differences of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, who are under no Law of God or Nations, but their own Will and Power, who are always watching Advantages to prey upon their weaker, or leſs ſuſpicious Neighbours: Such in God's juſt Judgment oft bring Ruine, or ſore Troubles upon their Countrey. They that <hi>travel with Iniquity, conceive Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and bring forth Falſhood, dig and make Pits for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fall into the Ditch that they made; their Miſchief returns upon their own Heads, and their violent dealing upon their own Pate,</hi> Pſal. 7.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>The unrighteous Aggreſſors meddle to their own hurt, and reap nothing but the Shame of being treacherous, and the Vengeance with which a juſt God repays it. We might give abundance of inſtances from Hiſtory, and not a few of recent Date; beſides what roar'd ſo loud from <hi>Vienna;</hi> and ſince upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> in invading the Empire, during the not expired Truce. But the Scripture-inſtances of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who might have liv'd quietly at home; but at <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> where he was, the Aggreſſor died by an Arrow of God's own guiding, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34. And eſpecially of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> who had ruled well and proſperouſly, when he fell into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.14. and deſpiſed Admonition, <hi>v.</hi> 15. God left him to himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 20. to pick an unjuſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with his Neighbour, <hi>Joaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whoſe wiſe and friendly Counſels of Peace, when he had proudly and obſtinately refuſed to hearken, he routed his Army, took him himſelf Priſoner, broke down the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and brought his Kingdom to ſuch diſtreſs, as was ſcarcely ever known to overwhelm it: All which had been prevented, had Righteouſneſs prevail'd to keep him quiet.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53749:16"/>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, To paſs by many more Advantages, it gives a Nation Reputation, that all their Neighbours are affraid to moleſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou wilt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his Ways, all People of the Earth ſhall ſee that thou art called by the Name of the Lord, and they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thee,</hi> Deut. 28.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Yea, make them court their Friendſhip, and ſeek their Alliance; <hi>When a Man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh his Enemies to be at Peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16.7. and that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Paſſage, Zech. 8.28. <hi>Ten Men,</hi> a number of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that is, very many <hi>of all Languages of the Nations, ſhall take hold of the Skirt of one that is a Jew; ſaying, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are a few of the Reaſons why, and Means by which Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation; makes it flouriſh, and ſets it up in Honour, Safety, Plenty, and in all deſirable Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and are in Truth, comparatively, but a taſte and ſprinkling, but one Cluſter of Grapes, ſuch as the Spies brought from the Brook of <hi>Eſhcol,</hi> Numb. 13.23. to ſhew what Fruits a Land of Righteouſneſs brings forth for its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, Unrighteouſneſs, Iniquity, and Sin pull down upon any People all God's Curſes; and where they prevail, <hi>The Vine</hi> of that Land <hi>is the Vine of Sodom, and of the Fields of Gomorrah; the Grapes are Grapes of Gall, their Cluſters are bitter; Their Wine is the Poiſon of Dragons, and the cruel Venom of Aſps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Right Honourable, much honoured, and well-beloved in our Lord, I humbly beg your leave that I may, and your Patience whilſt, I endeavour to make a free impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial improvement of what hath been delivered, in a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Application.</p>
            <p>I ſhall diſpatch it in two Uſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Information.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Exhortation.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53749:17"/>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Information. If Piety, Equity, and Honeſty exalt a Land, its People and Government, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Safety, Plenty, render it proſperous and ſlouriſhing. Let me draw theſe Four inſtructive Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us learn hence who are the moſt faithful to their Country's Intereſt, and the trueſt Friends to Government, righteous, religious, juſt, ſober, upright, honeſt Men; or profane, godleſs, unjuſt debauch'd, fraudulent, diſhoneſt ones.</p>
            <p>A Man would think it impoſſible to err, in making Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſo plain a Caſe: For ſurely they are better Friends who do it good, than they that do it miſchief; they that hold it up, than they that pull it down; they that engage God to be its Defender, than thoſe who provoke him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Enemy; they that ſerve it, than thoſe who ſerve themſelves of it.</p>
            <p>And yet, however it comes to paſs, never was poiſon'd Weapon ſo conſtantly made uſe of, as this; I ſay, as this againſt the beſt and honeſteſt of Men, that they were not Friends to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> true to their Country's Intereſt and Government.</p>
            <p>That it ſhould be thus very frequently, is not unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table nor need it ſeem ſtrange, if we conſider that moſt Governments have been idolatrous, licentious, wicked; and as the moſt are the worſt, the Community too ready to comply with them, and applaud them as being like them, and making their corrupt advantage of them. Thoſe who could not do ſo, but ſhewed the moſt innocent diſlike, and moſt modeſtly bewailed, or reproved what they ſaw amiſs, were ſtigmatized and branded with this hateful Character, as Enemies to the Publick, as the moſt ſwinging Revenge they could take of them, as expoſing them to the greateſt Hate and Danger.</p>
            <p>Thus it fared with <hi>Noah</hi> in the old World.</p>
            <p>And thus was <hi>Lot</hi> treated in <hi>Sodom,</hi> becauſe his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul was vexed with their Abominations, and could
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53749:17"/>not comply; and becauſe he diſſuaded them from an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, not to be named, as modeſtly and kindly, as, the oylieſt Words could expreſs it, <hi>I pray you, Brethren, do not ſo wickedly,</hi> Gen. 19.7. they reproach him as a buſie malepert aſſuming Fellow, which muſt needs be, forſooth, a <hi>Sodom</hi>-mender, <hi>This Fellow came in to be a Sojourner, and he will needs be a Judge; therefore will we deal worſe with thee than with them.</hi> Gen. 19.7.</p>
            <p>Thus it fared with <hi>David</hi> amongſt <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sycophants; though he ventured his Life far, and wrought ſuch great Salvations for his People, and was ſo innocent beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that <hi>Saul</hi> was conſtrained, more than once, to acknowledge him more righteous than himſelf. The Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was too hot for him; and he found more ſhelter amongſt the Philiſtins, whoſe Champion he had ſlain, than in his own Countrey; for the ſake of which, he put his Life in his Hand, and ventured the Combat in which he ſlew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliah</hi> was the Troubler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though in Truth the Chariots and Horſemen; and <hi>Jeſabel</hi> muſt have his Head.</p>
            <p>And holy <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the beſt Man then alive, <hi>muſt dye as one, who ſought not the Welfare of his People, but their Hurt,</hi> Jer. 38.4. and King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> himſelf had much ado to ſave him.</p>
            <p>The Time would fail me to tell you of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah, Daniel, Amos,</hi> whoſe Words the Land could not bear; and of all the Prophets, and Old Teſtament Saints, of which <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 11th gives ſo large an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: And they of the New Teſtament ſped no better; 'tis more than petty Treaſon in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to tell <hi>Herod,</hi> 'twas unlawful to have his Brother's Wife, and his Head muſt pay for it. Our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, was accuſed for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Caeſar, Perverting the Nation, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give Tribute to Caeſar, St.</hi> Luke 23.2. So impudent was their Malice, to lie in a Matter of Fact, when he had vindicated <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Right in ſet conference with them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53749:18"/>and bid them give <hi>to Caeſar the things which were Caeſars;</hi> Mark. 12.17. and wrought a complicated Miracle to pay him Tribute: Mat. 17.27. Nay, <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf was bugbear'd into the Murther of the Lord of Glory, by this Weapon, <hi>If thou let this Man go, thou art not Caeſar's Friend.</hi> Joh. 19.12.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator was hired to accuſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that elect Veſſel, he could find no ranker Poiſon, in which to dip his venal Tongue, than, <hi>We found this Man a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fellow, and a Mover of Sedition,</hi> Acts 24.5. And his Fellows, the Holy Apoſtles, were ſhot at with the like invenom'd Arrows. And the Primitive Chriſtians, becauſe they could not ſwear by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> or offer Incenſe to his Statue; though they prayed for him moſt zealouſly, obeyed him moſt loyally, in all things conſiſtent with their obeying God, and lived moſt innocently and uſefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Fellow-Subjects; yet were eſteemed no better than Traytors and Rebels, and common Enemies of Mankind: But I hope better things now.</p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Inference:</hi> If Righteouſneſs exalt, and Sin reproach a Nation: They take wrong Meaſures, and give others falſe aim, who think the carnal Policy of conniving at Men's Unrighteouſneſs, and humouring them in their Luſts; and winning them, by laying the Reins of their Wickedneſs looſe upon their Necks, leſt they grow turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and kick, if they feel the Curb or Spur, is the only way to ſettle a Nation, and ſecure its Intereſt, in Honour, Safety, Peace. Surely this is to build with untempered Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and the Wall, ſo built, will fall, and overwhelm thoſe, who vainly hoped to be ſheltred and defended by it: For God hath ſaid; <hi>Let Favour be ſhewed to the Wicked; yet will he not learn Righteouſneſs: In the Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs will he deal unjuſtly, and will not behold the Majeſty of the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 26.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may hence conjecture, yea foreſee, what is like to be the Fate of Nations, according to the Prevalency of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Sin, in the midſt of them; 'tis in proportion like to be with People, as with Perſons.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53749:18"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Say to the Righteous, it ſhall be well with them; for they ſhall eat the Fruit of their Doings. Say to the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with them; for the Reward of his Hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Iſa. 3.10.</p>
            <p>The Words of <hi>Micah</hi> are ſo appoſite, and ſo very awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, that I cannot forbear tranſcribing them; hoping you will conſider from ſo great a Prophet, what you would not mind from ſo mean a Speaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of Might, to declare unto Jacob his Tranſgreſſions, and to Iſrael his Sin.</hi> Micah 3.8. <hi>Hear this, I pray you, ye Heads of the Houſe of Jacob, and Princes of the Houſe of Iſrael, that abhor Judgment, and pervert all Equity,</hi> v. 9. <hi>They build up Zion with Blood, and Jeruſalem with Iniquity,</hi> v. 10. <hi>The Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for Hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for Money: Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? None Evil can come among us,</hi> v. 11. Now comes their Doom: <hi>Therefore ſhall Zion for your ſakes be plowed as a Field, and Jeruſalem ſhall become Heaps, and the Mountain of the Houſe, as the high Places of the Foreſt,</hi> v. 12. Such Vengeance will a righteous God, ſooner or later, cauſe to overtake unrighteous Nations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. See what an infinite Advantage it is, to have Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs flouriſh, and righteous Men advanced into Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who may by their Example bring it into Reputation, and by their Power encourage and protect it: And <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra; When the Righteous are in Authority, the People rejoice: But when the Wicked beareth Rule, the People mourn:</hi> And good reaſon they have to do ſo, if they love their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and my Text be Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Exhortation, 1. In general to all. 2. In particular to thoſe concern'd on this ſolemn Occaſion.</p>
            <p>In general, I beſeech you all in the Bowels of Chriſt, who ſhed his Bloud to <hi>redeem us from iniquity, and to purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53749:19"/>Which he hath appointed us to walk in: Yea, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and charge you in the Name of the Great, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and the Dreadful Judge of Quick and Dead, to whom we muſt all ſhortly give an Account; yea, I adjure you, by all that's dear to you, and may be moving with you, as <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Parents,</hi> as <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> as you love and deſire the Proſperity of your <hi>Souls,</hi> your <hi>Families,</hi> your <hi>Native Country,</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> under which you enjoy ſo many Comforts, your <hi>Church,</hi> your <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> which is our Glory; By all theſe, and by whatever elſe may be named, or thought on, that you love, practiſe, and promote with your utmoſt Induſtry and Zeal, in your <hi>Perſons, Families, Neighbourhood,</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, unreſerved <hi>Righteouſneſs, Piety, Equity, Honeſty,</hi> every one in your Places and Capacities: This is <hi>Totum Hominis;</hi> the Summ of your Duty, Buſineſs, Happineſs; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all Evil, Name and Thing, Act and Appearance. Let not <hi>Impiety, Iniquity, Diſhoneſty, be ſo much as once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among you, as becometh Saints,</hi> Eph. 5.3. unleſs with deteſtation and abhorrences <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. And <hi>have no Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with any unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, but reprove them rather:</hi> And <hi>follow after Peace with all Men, and Holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well; awake to Righteouſneſs, and ſin not:</hi> Iſa. 1. Yea, <hi>Die to Sin, and live to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, and walk righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Giving to God, thy Neighbour, and thy Self, what's due to every of them, with a Conſcience void of offence to all. And this is the Way, the only ſure Way, to ſave thy Soul from the Wrath to come, and your Selves, and <hi>dear Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> your <hi>dearer Countrey,</hi> your <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſhould be <hi>deareſt</hi> of them all; from the threatning Dangers, and impending Storm which our mighty Sins have gathered into ſo dark a Cloud, ſo ready to break, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53749:19"/>to diſcharge it ſelf upon our guilty Heads: Without this, all will ſucceed ill, were our Armies as numerous as thoſe of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> or <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and all as valiant, and daring as their Royal Leader; our Fleet as gallant as that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered at <hi>Lepanto;</hi> our Sinews of War, a Fund as inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible as the Ocean; and the Arm of Fleſh as ſtrong as <hi>Hercules,</hi> or <hi>Samſon,</hi> or you can wiſh, or fanſie; all will dwindle, and melt, and vaniſh into nothing, if God blow upon us, or <hi>hide his Face.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath told you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. That your <hi>Iniquities</hi> perſiſted in, and <hi>Sins</hi> unrepented of, will make him do it.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, What would you have us do? <hi>The Flouds of ungodly Men make us affraid,</hi> Pſal. 18.4. <hi>He that departeth from Evil, makes himſelf a Prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.15. Our very Remedy is turned into our Diſeaſe; Religion, which ſhould help us, is turn'd againſt it ſelf; and the Form of it combats againſt the Power, almoſt as dangerouſly as an open Enemy. <hi>Omnia cùm liceant, non licet (impunè) eſſe pium. If the Foundations be removed, what can the Righteous do? Pſal.</hi> 11.3. I'll tell you as plainly as I can.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take heed of Hypocriſie, and overweening Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Singularity. <hi>Phariſaical Cenſuring,</hi> and <hi>Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> others, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. and ſaying, <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, I am holier than thou,</hi> Iſa. 65.5. Make not things worſe than they are; nor brand every one thou fanſieſt not to be thy Friend, as an Enemy of God; nor the ſincere Devotions of others, to be meer Formalities, becauſe they would be ſo in thy ſelf, if thou ſhouldſt uſe them with thy preſent Principles, and Prejudices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be not diſcouraged to do thy Duty, becauſe others neglect theirs; not ſcar'd from promoting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by the reproach of Singularity. 'Tis better to be righteous alone, than wicked with the greateſt company, or in company of the greateſt. Conſider what our Lord's Interrogatory implies; <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> Mat. 5.47. Remember there is a Praiſe-worthy, as well as a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53749:20"/>Blame-worthy affected Singularity. If others will not do their Duty to ſave a Nation, let not that hinder thee from doing thine: <hi>Let them return to thee; but return not thou to them,</hi> Jer. 15.19. There is nothing of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives more ſignal Inſtances, than the beſt Men ſtanding ſingle, and alone in their Places and Generaaions. <hi>Noah, Job, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes ſtood in the Gap,</hi> to turn away Wrath from <hi>Iſrael. Joſeph, Elijah, I am left alone. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah, Daniel, Few find the narrow Way,</hi> Mat. 7.14. St. <hi>Paul, Athanaſius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be exhorted therefore to mourn, at leaſt, for all the Abominations in the midſt of us; as thoſe good Souls did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. and God will ſet his Mark upon thee; and if thou canſt not deliver a Nation, <hi>no nor Son, nor Daughter, thou ſhalt however deliver thy own Soul,</hi> Ezek. 14.20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cry mightily to God to pardon thy own, and the Nation's Impiety, Iniquity, Improbity, and with an holy and pathetick vehemency, call to Heaven and Earth in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Drop down, ye Heavens, from above, and let the Skies pour down Righteouſneſs: Let the Earth open, and let them bring forth Salvation; and let Righteouſneſs ſpring up together:</hi> And ſue out thoſe gracious Promiſes that God hath made to his Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Righteouſneſs, yet to be fulfilled; to haſten their Accompliſhment: Such as theſe, amongſt many. <hi>I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellers, as at the beginning; afterwards thou ſhalt be called a City of Righteouſneſs, the faithful City,</hi> Iſa. 1.26. <hi>In Righteouſneſs ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed, and ſhalt be far from Oppreſſion,</hi> Chap. 54.14. <hi>I will make thy Officers Peace, and thine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters Righteouſneſs,</hi> ch. 60.17. — ver. 21. <hi>Thy People alſo ſhall be all righteous.</hi> And pray down that <hi>New Heaven, and New Earth, wherein Righteouſneſs ſhall dwell;</hi> which we expect, and St. <hi>John ſaw deſcending,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13. Rev. 21.1.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53749:20"/>
            <p n="2">II. The Second Branch of the Exhortation I ſhall direct to all concerned in the ſolemn Buſineſs of the Day; Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs and Defendants, Counſellers and Pleaders, Jurors and Witneſſes. I beſeech, and warn you, to do all you do, ſay all you ſay, as in the ſight and hearing of him who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly, and will render to every Man according to his Deeds: <hi>All whoſe Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity; juſt and right is he,</hi> Deut. 32.4.</p>
            <p>And if we muſt give an Account <hi>for every idle Word at the Day of Judgment,</hi> Mat. 12.36. how much more for every falſe, malicious, ſcornful Word, ſpoken before a ſacred <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>Judgment?</hi> Briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do to others, as you would others ſhould do to you. None of you would be falſly witneſſed againſt, ſworn out of your Eſtates, Lives, Liberties, by a falſe Oath, or have advantage taken of your Ignorance, or Weakneſs, to oppreſs you in Judgment, or be run down by Noiſe and Clamour? Do not ſerve others ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do as Conſcience will do by you at that Tribunal whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are haſtning; that will then ſpeak the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth. Let that guide you, not Favour, nor Affection, Love, or Hatred, Faction, or Partiality, Expectation of Reward, or Fear of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let me, without imputation of indecent Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or immodeſt Boldneſs. My <hi>Right Honourable Lords,</hi> the <hi>Reverend Judges,</hi> be your Remembrancer, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you in your Duty; which you know much better than I can teach it; but to encourage you to perſiſt in the performance of it.</p>
            <p>As the Nations Happineſs abſolutely depends upon the flouriſhing of Righteouſneſs, and its <hi>flowing down as a mighty Stream;</hi> ſo the promoting of Godlineſs and Piety, Juſtice and Equity, Honeſty and Probity, doth much depend upon your Love to them, Zeal for them, and Courage to execute true Judgment with Impartiality and Truth.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:53749:21"/>
            <p>The Motives to it, are ſo many, and ſo cogent, I have neither need, nor time to reckon them up; I only beſeech you always to carry them with you, and often to reflect upon them.</p>
            <p>One is inſtead of all; which I ſhall repeat in the Words of the good and great <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.6. <hi>Take heed what you do; for you judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in Judgment.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Wherefore now let the Fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed, and do it; for there is no iniquity with the Lord, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of Gifts; thus ſhall you do faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And what Cauſe ſoever ſhall come to you of your Brethren, between Bloud and Bloud, Law and Commandments, Statutes and Judgments, you ſhall warn them that they treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs not againſt the Lord, and ſo Wrath come upon you, and upon your Brethren: This do, and you ſhall not treſpaſs.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>Deal courageouſly, and the Lord ſhall be with the Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſcus Alverius</hi> writes of ſome <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Judges, who ſate upon the Foot-ſtool of their Chairs, leaving the Seat empty for God, or Angels to ſit in.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, That Judgment uſed to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred near the Temples, that the Reverence of the Deity might bend the Judges Mind to the doing of Juſtice; and I humbly hope, this taking the Pulpit in the way to the Bench, may have the like Effect: <hi>Amen.</hi>
